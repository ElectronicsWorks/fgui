fgui - GUI toolkit for microcontrollers
=======================================
Bj√∏rn Forsman <bjorn (dot) forsman (at) gmail (dot) com>

WARNING: fgui is pre-alpha software.

fgui is a small GUI toolkit written in C. It is designed to run on very small
embedded systems, i.e. 8-bit microcontrollers and up, while still provinding an
easy to use API.

fgui widgets are placed in a tree structure and input events propagate from the
currently focused widget and all the way up to the root widget. If a widget
signals that it has handled the event, the propagation stops. Widgets that
support user callbacks also support a userdata pointer.

To use fgui, the application must initialize its display device and supply an
implementation of this function:

  fgui_set_pixel(uint16_t x, uint16_t y, uint32_t color)

Then include `fgui.h` and explore the API. Basic drawing primitives such as
line and rectangle are located in `fgui_primitives.h`. Font drawing is in
`fgui_font.h` and the widgets are located in `fgui_<widget>.h`. fgui is
object-oriented and `fgui_widget.h` is the base "class" for all widgets.

fgui comes with an http://www.libsdl.org/[SDL] demo program, try it:

----
$ cd fgui && mkdir build && cmake .. && make && ./demo/fgui_demo
----


Features
--------

* basic drawing primitives:
** line
** rectangle (empty + filled)
** circle (empty + filled)
** triangle (only empty)
* monospaced font drawing
* widgets:
** label
** push button - supports "on click" callback
** lineedit - single line text input
** combobox - supports "item changed" callback
* no dynamic memory allocation
* example/demo program using fgui with SDL, http://www.libsdl.org/


Planned features
----------------

* widgets:
** hierarchical menu (submenus and actions)
* widget coordinates relative to parent
* make parent widgets draw their children (currently all widgets must be drawn
  'manually' by the application)
* clipping (widgets should not draw anything outside their border)
* input validators (for textedit)
* multi-tap input method
